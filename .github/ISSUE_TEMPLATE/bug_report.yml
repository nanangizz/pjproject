        e.g:
        1. run pjsua app with parameter: `--video --registrar sip:some.sip.registrar ...`
        1. make video call from other SIP client or another pjsua instance
        1. answer the call with 180 and soon 183, assertion occurs!
        The assertion didn't occur if the call was answered with 183 directly.
